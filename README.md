# Simple chat created using React/Redux

[Chat]()
## This app is an example of using Redux to save data (in this example it is a messages).

In this app you can write messages, they will appear in the chat and delete the message by clicking on it.
I created styles based on information from the figma [layout](https://www.figma.com/file/SNq4sYquUbR705Fq8Dp6RO/Test-%2F-Dev-%2F-Stubbs?node-id=0%3A1). 
There is no adaptive design. The screen width must be 1440px to display the app correctly.

### I have built this app using:

- HTML/CSS
- React JS
- Redux

### Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
### To start this app:

### `npm i`

This will install the packages you need.
